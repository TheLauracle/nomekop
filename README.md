Compsci independent study project. Idk what this is. But it's going to be a browser game and it's going to be great.

As of 2018, development has resumed at a half-baked pace because I am bored and I have spare time. Also, this was probably my favorite independent study project and it doesn't deserve to be left unfinished forever.
